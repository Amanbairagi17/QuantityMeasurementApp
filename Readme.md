#  Quantity Measurement Application

A scalable, object-oriented Java application designed to perform 
**measurement comparison, conversion, and arithmetic operations** 
across multiple unit categories such as Length and Weight.

---

##  Project Objective

This project demonstrates how to build a clean, extensible, and type-safe 
measurement system using strong OOP principles and architectural best practices.

The system supports:

-  Equality comparison across compatible units  
-  Unit-to-unit conversion with base unit normalization  
-  Arithmetic operations (addition) across mixed units  
-  Multi-category support (Length, Weight)  
-  Generic architecture using Java Generics and Interfaces  

---

##  Architectural Evolution

The project evolves incrementally across multiple use cases (UC1–UC10), 
starting from basic equality checks and progressing toward a fully 
generic, reusable `Quantity<U>` design.

Key architectural milestones include:

- Encapsulation & Immutability
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Refactoring
- Enum-based Unit Abstraction
- Separation of Concerns
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Interface-driven Generic Design
- Multi-Category Type Safety

---

##  Core Technical Concepts Demonstrated

- Value Objects in Java  
- Overriding `equals()` 
- Floating-point precision handling (`Double.compare`, epsilon tolerance)  
- Enum as behavior carrier  
- Generic programming with bounded type parameters  
- Interface-based abstraction (`IMeasurable`)  
- Compile-time and runtime type safety  
- Immutable domain modeling  

---

## Supported Measurement Categories

### Length Units
- Feet  
- Inches  
- Yards  
- Centimeters  

###  Weight Units
- Kilogram  
- Gram  
- Pound

## Testing Strategy

The application includes comprehensive test using JUnit.
